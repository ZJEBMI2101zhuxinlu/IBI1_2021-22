human-mouse: 
the	alignment score is 1490
the	percentage of identical	amino acids	is 96.53979238754326%

human-random:
the	alignment score is -351
the	percentage of identical	amino acids	is 2.768166089965396%

mouse-random:
the alignment score is -348
the	percentage of identical	amino acids	is 3.114186851211076%

interpretation:
Larger alignment score and percentage indicate greater similarity between the two DNA sequences. Therefore, The DLX5 gene is very similar in human and mouse. Whereas they are very different from random sequence.This reflects that the DLX5 gene is highly conserved in evolution and may have an essential role in both humans and mice.
